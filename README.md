# JConSplit

General description:

This Java project splits files based on occurrences of a pattern specified by the user.

To do:
1. Add detailed documentation.
2. Clean up the code!
3. Replace the original pattern matching code with riversrun's bigdoc library! https://github.com/riversun/bigdoc
4. ~~Add support for different lengths of hex patterns. (Only 16 byte patterns currently supported due to a bug that I am investigating.)~~ Done!
5. ~~Add support for splitting based on lengths instead of patterns as well. (Just trying to be thorough here!)~~
6. ~~Add support for concatenation.~~ Number 5 and 6 are probably not happening.
