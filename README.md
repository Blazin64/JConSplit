# JConSplit

General description:

This Java project splits files based on occurrences of a pattern specified by the user.

To do:
1. Add detailed documentation.
2. Clean up the code!
3. Replace the original pattern matching code with riversun's bigdoc library! https://github.com/riversun/bigdoc It much more optimized that the code that is currently being used in JConSplit.
4. ~~Add support for different lengths of hex patterns. (Only 16 byte patterns currently supported due to a bug that I am investigating.)~~ Done!
5. Maybe add support for splitting based on length instead of patterns.
6. Maybe add support for concatenation.
