# JConSplit

General description:

This Java project splits files based on occurrences of a pattern specified by the user.

News:
This project is now proudly using riversun's bigdoc library! See the library at https://github.com/riversun/bigdoc

To do:
1. Add detailed documentation.
2. Clean up the code!
3. Maybe add support for splitting based on length instead of patterns.
4. Maybe add support for concatenation.
