# JConSplit

General description:

This Java project splits files based on occurrences of a pattern specified by the user.

To do:
1. Add detailed documentation.
2. Clean up the code!
3. Replace the original pattern matching code with riversun's bigdoc library! https://github.com/riversun/bigdoc It is much more optimized than the code that is currently being used in JConSplit.
4. Maybe add support for splitting based on length instead of patterns.
5. Maybe add support for concatenation.
